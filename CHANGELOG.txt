0.2.2 for 6.3.1
Released ???

    Additions:
    * Added custom broadcasts for several event spawns, such as the legendary birds and Arceus.

    Changes in messages.conf:
    * Added "toggle.summon_toggles", "toggle.summon.on" and "toggle.summon.off". Edit in or refresh.

    Changes to permissions:
    * Added "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.summon.birdtrio".

    Fixes and tweaks:
    * Moved the vanilla legendary message warning to a later start-up phase. People were missing it.

    Note: The messages.conf in 0.2.1 said it was unchanged, but I forgot I added normal toggles. Sorry.

0.2.1 for 6.3.0
Released June 10th, 2018.

    Fixes and tweaks:
    * Fixed %biome% on spawns and catches always showing the biome at 0, 0, 0.
    * Fixed %xpos%, %ypos% and %zpos% not working right.
    * Fixed an odd error where a Pokémon could apparently forfeit a fight with another Pokémon.
    * Fixed normal catch and blackout messages not being toggle-able.
    * Fixed PvP draws referencing two removed "toggle.pvp_draw" keys, and a missing comma.
    * Toggle categories now sort mostly alphabetically. Stuff was changing too often to keep up with.

0.2.0 for 6.3.0
Released June 9th, 2018.

    Permission changes:
    * "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.trade.normal" is now "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.trade".
    * All "defeat"-type permissions are now "victory"-type permissions to avoid confusion.
    * PvP "start"/"end" permissions have been merged into the old "challenge"/"victory" groups.

    Additions:
    * Added support for showing catches and blackouts for Pokémon that aren't special.
    * Added a lang option for showing neutral stats in hovers, instead of just "ERROR".
    * Rewrote configuration/translation with a three-file setup, found in the PixelmonBroadcasts folder.
    * The %world% and %biome% placeholders should now work properly on trainer/PvP broadcasts.
    * Trades now support the showing of shiny Pokémon, using the new %shiny% placeholder.

    Fixes and tweaks:
    * Enabled showing IVs on Pokémon that a player lost to or fled from. Turn off hover to disable.
    * Fixed an issue where old options would occasionally get stuck when reloading with changes made.
    * Fixed some potential bugs with players with edited names. There may be more, please report.
    * Removed a few leftover debug messages when players blacked out to wild Pokémon. Oops.
    * Updated CHANGELOG.txt with missed changes in 0.1.1, and corrected versions.
