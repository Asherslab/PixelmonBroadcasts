0.2.0 for 6.3.0
Released ???

    Permission changes:
    * "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.trade.normal" is now "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.trade".

    Additions:
    * Split up configuration into three separate files, found in the PixelmonBroadcasts folder.
    * Added on-the-fly translation support. Changed messages now apply immediately on file save!
    * Added a lang option for showing neutral stats in hovers, instead of just "ERROR".
    * Trades now support the showing of shiny Pokémon, using the new %shiny% placeholder.

    Fixes and tweaks:
    * Enabled showing IVs on Pokémon that a player blacked out to. Turn off the hover to disable.
    * Fixed some potential bugs with players with edited names. There may be more, please report.
    * Removed a few leftover debug messages when players blacked out to wild Pokémon. Oops.
    * Updated CHANGELOG.txt with missed changes in 0.1.1, and corrected versions.
