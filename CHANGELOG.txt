0.2.0 for 6.3.0
Released June 9th, 2018.

    Permission changes:
    * "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.trade.normal" is now "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.trade".
    * All "defeat"-type permissions are now "victory"-type permissions to avoid confusion.
    * PvP "start"/"end" permissions have been merged into the old "challenge"/"victory" groups.

    Additions:
    * Added support for showing catches and blackouts for Pokémon that aren't special.
    * Added a lang option for showing neutral stats in hovers, instead of just "ERROR".
    * Rewrote configuration/translation with a three-file setup, found in the PixelmonBroadcasts folder.
    * The %world% and %biome% placeholders should now work properly on trainer/PvP broadcasts.
    * Trades now support the showing of shiny Pokémon, using the new %shiny% placeholder.

    Fixes and tweaks:
    * Enabled showing IVs on Pokémon that a player lost to or fled from. Turn off hover to disable.
    * Fixed an issue where old options would occasionally get stuck when reloading with changes made.
    * Fixed some potential bugs with players with edited names. There may be more, please report.
    * Removed a few leftover debug messages when players blacked out to wild Pokémon. Oops.
    * Updated CHANGELOG.txt with missed changes in 0.1.1, and corrected versions.
