Here's how to use the files that are in here:

1. Shut down the server, or make these edits in a local copy.
2. Find a language file for the language you want to use.
3. Copy en_US.lang somewhere safe.
4. If you pick another language, rename the file to en_US.lang.
5. Make any changes you want to make to this file.
6. Boot the server.

I'm pretty new to the whole language file thing, but new translations are welcome!
If you've got a file to contribute, shoot me a message on Discord: XpanD#1337

Thanks!
