If you want to use another existing translation...
1. Shut down the server.
2. Move en_US.lang somewhere safe.
3. Find a language file for the language you want to use.
4. Rename the file to en_US.lang.
5. Move the file back to the location of the original en_US.lang, if need be.
6. Boot the server.

If you want to create your own translation, or edit the active one...
1. Shut down the server.
2. Copy en_US.lang somewhere safe.
3. Move the copy that you want to edit somewhere where it's easy to access.
4. Open this copy with a text editor of choice.
5. Make any changes you want to make to this file.
6. Make sure the file is named "en_US.lang", without the quotes.
7. Move the changed file back to the original lang file location.
8. Boot the server.

I'm pretty new to the whole lang file thing, but new translations are welcome!
