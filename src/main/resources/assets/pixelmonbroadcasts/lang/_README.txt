Here's how to use the files that are in here:

1. Shut down the server, or do this stuff in a local copy.
2. Find a language file for the language you want to use.
3. Copy en_US.lang somewhere safe.
4. If you pick another language, rename the file to en_US.lang.
5. Make any changes you want to make to this file.
6. Copy the file back to where the original en_US file was at.
7. Boot the server.

I'm pretty new to the whole lang file thing, but new translations are welcome!
If you want to contribute or just have a question, shoot me a message.
Keep in mind that stuff may still change, this guide included.
