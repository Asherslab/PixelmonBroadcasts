# PIXELMON BROADCASTS CONFIGURATION FILE
#
# SUPPORTED PLACEHOLDERS:
#   - %biome%, %ivpercent%, %pokemon%, %player%, %world%, %xpos%, %ypos%, %zpos%
#
# NOTES:
#   - This sidemod is currently in beta -- functionality may change!
#   - To translate more messages, check the .lang files inside the .jar.
#   - Commands will generally not trigger our events, technical reasons. :(
#   - IVs cannot be shown on spawns due to a Pixelmon bug randomizing them.
#   - Showing stats on legendary/shiny kill is great fun. Evil, but fun. ;)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# # # CONFIG VERSION - DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS TOLD TO! # # #
# This is used internally to check for outdated (and possibly dangerous) configs.
# If needed, we show a warning on boot. The sidemod may be disabled until fixed.

# # # COMMAND ALIAS # # #
# A forward slash will automatically be added where necessary, don't add one.
# If you do not want to create an alias, set this to: "pixelmonbroadcasts"
commandAlias = "pbroadcasts"

# # # OPTION TOGGLES # # #
# Present words determine which features are enabled/disabled.
# "log" = Log this event to the console and the server logs.
# "show" = Show this event's message to players, provided they have permissions.
# "hover" = Make this event's message show the Pokémon's stats when hovered over.
# Note: Hovers are currently unsupported on trades, and do nothing without "show".
# Pro tip: If you enable normal legendary/hatch messages, enable shiny ones as well.

# # # EVENT MESSAGES # # #
# These are shown when "show" is set above. Some placeholders are event-specific.
# To show the other side's stats on trades, add a 2 to the placeholder names.
# Note: Don't add %ivpercent% to spawn messages. See the main notes for more info.
# Pro tip: Underline ("&n") hoverable messages (or parts of them) for clarity.

# # # CHARACTERS/SEPARATORS # # #

# statLineStart gets put in front of stat-showing lines and command helpers.
# If you don't know what these do, don't worry about them.
