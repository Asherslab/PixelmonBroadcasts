# PIXELMON BROADCASTS CONFIGURATION FILE

# SUPPORTED PLACEHOLDERS:
#   - %biome%, %ivpercent%, %pokemon%, %player%, %world%, %xpos%, %ypos%, %zpos%
#
# NOTES:
#   - This sidemod is currently in beta -- functionality WILL change!
#   - To translate more messages, check the .lang files inside the .jar.
#   - Translations will likely be overhauled later. Don't go too crazy.
#   - Commands will generally not trigger our events, technical reasons. :(
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# # # CONFIG VERSION - DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS TOLD TO! # # #
# This is used internally to check for outdated (and possibly dangerous) configs.
# If needed, we show a warning on boot. The sidemod may be disabled until fixed.
configVersion = 10

# # # COMMAND ALIAS # # #
# A forward slash will automatically be added where necessary, don't add one.
# If you do not want to create an alias, set this to: "pixelmonbroadcasts"
commandAlias = "pbroadcasts"

# # # OPTION TOGGLES # # #
# Present words determine which features are enabled/disabled.
# "log" = Log this event to the console and the server logs.
# "show" = Show this event's message to players, provided they have permissions.
# "hover" = Shows the Pokémon's stats when the message is hovered over. Needs "show".
# Note: Hovers are currently unsupported on trades and trainer/PvP battle messages.
# Note: IVs do not currently work on spawns and challenges due to a Pixelmon bug.
# Pro tip: If you enable normal legendary/hatch messages, enable shiny ones as well.

# # # EVENT MESSAGES # # #
# These are shown when "show" is set above. Some placeholders are event-specific!
# To show another side's info on supported messages, add a 2 to placeholder names.
# Pro tip: Underline ("&n") hoverable messages (or parts of them) for clarity.
# Pro tip: Showing stats on legendary/shiny kill is fun! Evil, but fun. ;)
