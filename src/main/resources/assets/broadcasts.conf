# PIXELMON BROADCASTS BROADCAST MESSAGE FILE - VERSION 0.2.0
#
# NOTES:
#   - If you use a config from the internet, check to make sure it's up to date!
#   - To translate more stuff, open "messages.conf". Changes apply on save.
#
# KNOWN ISSUES:
#   - Commands will generally not trigger our events, technical reasons. :(
#   - On messages with two players, %biome%/%world%/%pos#% show player 1's data.
#
# PRO TIPS:
#   - Underline ("&n") hoverable messages (or parts of them) for clarity.
#   - Showing stats (hover) on legendary/shiny victory is fun! Evil, but fun. ;)
#
# SUPPORTED PLACEHOLDERS:
#   - %biome%, %world%
#   - %pokemon% + %player% (names)
#   - %ivpercent% (shows a Pokémon's percentage of total IVs, if not an egg)
#   - %xpos% + %ypos% + %zpos% (coordinates -- remember, Y is height in MC!)
#   - %shiny% (inserts "placeholder.shiny" if a Pokémon is shiny, used in trades)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# # # EVENT BROADCASTS # # #
# Some placeholders are event-specific! Test your changes.
# To show another side's info on supported messages, add a 2 to placeholder names.
