# BROADCAST MESSAGE FILE, VERSION 0.2.1 (unchanged since 0.2.0)
#
# IMPORTANT:
#   - Most messages support one or more placeholders from the list below.
#   - On supported messages, add a 2 to placeholder names to show the other side.
#   - Note that %biome%/%world%/%pos#% currently always show player 1's data.
#
# SUPPORTED PLACEHOLDERS:
#   - %biome%, %world%
#   - %pokemon% + %player% (names)
#   - %ivpercent% (shows a Pokémon's percentage of total IVs, if not an egg)
#   - %xpos% + %ypos% + %zpos% (coordinates -- remember, Y is height in MC!)
#   - %shiny% (inserts "placeholder.shiny" if a Pokémon is shiny, good for trades)
#
# PRO TIPS:
#   - Showing stats (hover) on legendary/shiny victory is fun! Evil, but fun. ;)
